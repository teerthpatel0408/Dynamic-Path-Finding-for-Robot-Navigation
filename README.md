It commences with the Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal simulation, highlighting the representation of obstacles, path nodes, and the queue, culminating in an enhanced BFS control enabling user interaction for endpoint selection. The subsequent section introduces the Depth-First Search (DFS) simulation, contrasting the stack-based approach with BFS's queue mechanism, and featuring a dynamic DFS control for user-directed endpoint determination.

The narrative transitions seamlessly to the Dijkstra algorithm, emphasizing the integration of user-defined cost functions within a 2D grid. Following this, the A* algorithm is introduced, incorporating heuristic values based on Euclidean distances to enhance pathfinding efficiency. A parallel discourse unfolds on the Invasive Weed Optimization (IC) algorithm, elucidating the Maze Navigator function and its role in generating DNA sequences for offspring, thereby navigating through a dynamic environment replete with obstacles.

The Genetic Algorithm section unveils a meticulously crafted framework, commencing with the Maze function's environment setup, the Step function dictating offspring movement while circumventing obstacles, and the Create New Population function orchestrating the generation of diverse DNA sequences. The narrative underscores the iterative nature of this process, iteratively creating new generations until the attainment of a goal state. A visual representation of generations is provided, elucidating the differentiation of population subsets through color-coded delineations.

Concluding the discourse, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is introduced, featuring functions for plotting circular obstacles, initializing particles, and evaluating loss functions. The inherent challenges of inconsistent results are meticulously addressed through a systematic exploration of parameter adjustments, specifically the augmentation of maximum iterations to 1,000, thereby culminating in the realization of a stable and accurate solution.
